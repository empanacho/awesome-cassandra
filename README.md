Apache Cassandra is a free and open-source, distributed, wide column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

This is a curated list of awesome [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) packages and resources. Maintained by Rahul Singh of [Anant](http://anant.us). Feel free contact me if you'd like to collaborate on this and other awesome lists. [Awesome Cassandra](https://github.com/Anant/awesome-cassandra) , [Awesome Solr](https://github.com/Anant/awesome-solr), [Awesome Lucene](https://github.com/Anant/awesome-lucene). This powers the *Resources* section of [Cassandra.Link](https://cassandra.link), a rich collection of blog feeds, and curated links as a searchable knowledge base.
